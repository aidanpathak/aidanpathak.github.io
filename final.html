<hr>
<p>Hello! For this final project, I'll be working with Braden Kane to complete a product using the machines we've trained with this semester.</p>
<p>This week we'll be using several machines to construct components for an edge-lit acrylic sign.</p>
<hr>
<p>To start, Braden and I spent some time brainstorming an idea for a product we could construct.</p>
<p>We knew we wanted to make something related to video games because we live in a suite with five gamers.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="redandblue.png"></p>
<p>Since Pokémon is one of Nintendo's best-selling franchises, and our suitemates have all played at least one Pokémon game, we decided to make something related to the Pokémon games.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="TrainerCard.png"></p>
<p>At first, we thought about designing the "trainer cards," a franchise staple found in most Pokémon media.</p>
<p>In the Pokémon games, these trainer cards showcase your progress and achievements as you complete your playthrough.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="design1.png"></p>
<p>Since every Wheaton student has an ID card, we figured we would replicate the trainer cards from Pokémon by laser-cutting a case to go around our Wheaton IDs.</p>
<p>The case would have comprised of two bodies:</p>
<p>One body to fit the card into and one body to hold the card in place.</p>
<p>These bodies would interlock using a simple stud mechanism, where the bottom body would fit into the top body.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, we decided to print something using the PrusaSlicer machines, so we moved on to a different design.</p>
<p>Instead of laser-cutting a case, we specifically focused on each trainer card's "gym badges."</p>
<p>In the franchise, each region has "gym challenges" that the player must beat to finish the game.</p>
<p>After completing a gym challenge, the player receives a corresponding badge on their trainer ID.</p>
<p>Essentially, gym badges are medals that highlight your progress when playing Pokémon.</p>
<p><img src="design2.png"></p>
<p>Our second design focused on 3D-printing the badges and displaying them in a case.</p>
<p>We took eight badges and planned a laser-cut display case to store them.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="badge1.jpg"></p>
<p>We decided to test the idea by taking one of the less-complicated badges and recreating it in Fusion 360.</p>
<br>
<p><img src="badge2.png"></p>
<p><img src="badge3.png"></p>
<p>We went further and designed one of the badges in Fusion360.</p>
<p>Since we planned on using the PrusaSlicer, we made the badge a solid color for a single print.</p>
<p><img src="badge4.png"></p>
<p><img src="badge5.png"></p>
<p>We even designed a two-tone version of the badge to print on the multi-color printers at Wheaton.</p>
<p>However, we decided to stay with the single-color version since most badge designs required too many colors.</p>
<p><img src="badge6.png"></p>
<p>After finishing the design, Braden and I printed a prototype badge.</p>
<p>We enjoyed the size and shape of our first version, but we both agreed that we needed a better way to display the badges.</p>
<p>We ditched the idea of a laser-cut box and started exploring ways to make rings.</p>
<p><img src="design2.1.png"></p>
<p>We began a model that interlocks the badges using a simple 3D-printed ring.</p>
<p>This design would use a stud mechanism similar to our first design.</p>
<p>However, we realized that we still needed to incorporate a second machine alongside the PrusaSlicer.</p>
<p><img src="design2.2.png"></p>
<p>We pivoted our idea of 3D-printing both the ring and the badge to incorporate the vinyl-cutter machine.</p>
<p>Instead of making multiple badge designs, we made a single ring that incorporates four separate pieces.</p>
<p><img src="lego.png"></p>
<p>We based the top piece on LEGO's stud pieces, but we flattened the top surface for applying vinyl stickers.</p>
<p>Incorporating the stud piece would allow us to have multiple interchangeable tops for the rings.</p>
<p>We found the stud measurements online and started recreating them in Fusion360.</p>
<p>However, as we were wrapping up the stud design...</p>
<p><img src="covid.png"></p>
<p>COVID-19 struck, so Braden and I had to work remotely :(</p>
<br>
<p>Braden had the stud file on his computer, and I had to wait for a COVID test, so it took quite a while before I could visit the lab to print the stud.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I took the opportunity to begin the sticker designs.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="badge7.png"></p>
<p>We decided to use these designs for the stickers, so I worked on making them ready for the vinyl-cutter.</p>
<p><img src="badges8.png"></p>
<p>I selected some of our favorite icons and isolated them using Photoshop.</p>
<p><img src="badge9.png"></p>
<p>Then I moved the file over to Illustrator and readied the icons for the vinyl-cutter.</p>
<p>(I also added a blank template)</p>
<p><img src="fusion1.png"></p>
<p>Braden sent the stud file over for me to print.</p>
<p>I received a negative COVID test result shortly after, so I went to the lab to print the file.</p>
<p><img src="software1.png"></p>
<p><img src="machine10.png"></p>
<p><img src="machine7.png"></p>
<p>I went to the lab printed our first version of the stud.</p>
<p>I used SLA and printed at draft speed, so the print quickly finished.</p>
<p><img src="stud3.png"></p>
<p><img src="stud5.png"></p>
<p>After successfully printing our first stud, we discussed our plans for connecting it to the ring.</p>
<p>Although we were pleased with the stud and badge icon designs, we weren't satisfied with our ring designs.</p>
<p>So, instead of connecting the stud to a ring, we decided to do more LEGO-inspired printing alongside the Pokémon themes.</p>
<p><img src="design4.png"></p>
<p><img src="design3.png"></p>
<p>I altered our ring design to include a LEGO branch piece, and Braden started converting the branch into Fusion360.</p>
<p><img src="branch7.png"></p>
<p>Braden sent the file over, and I went to print it at the lab.</p>
<p><img src="software2.png"></p>
<p>I loaded the file into the PrusaSlicer software and selected the draft speed.</p>
<p><img src="machine13.png"></p>
<p><img src="machine12.png"></p>
<p>This fast speed resulted in a failed print, so I went back to the PrusaSlicer and reduced the speed.</p>
<p><img src="machine9.png"></p>
<p>The print failed again, so I once again reduced the speed.</p>
<p>I also changed the SLA color to green because Braden and I decided to use a red-green color scheme.</p>
<p><img src="machine5.png"></p>
<p><img src="branch4.png"></p>
<p>Despite reducing the speed, this print failed well into the process.</p>
<p><img src="branch5.png"></p>
<p><img src="branch6.png"></p>
<p>However, the print demonstrated that the branch interlocks with the stud piece.</p>
<p><img src="branch3.png"></p>
<p><img src="branch1.png"></p>
<p>After several attempts, I finally succeeded in printing the branch.</p>
<p><img src="machine3.png"></p>
<p><img src="stud1.png"></p>
<p><img src="stud2.png"></p>
<p>Shortly after that, I successfully printed another stud using red PLA.</p>
<p>I also used sandpaper to flatten the top completely.</p>
<p><img src="branch2.png"></p>
<p>Here are the two pieces side-by-side.</p>
