      <hr>
      <p>Welcome to week two of Digital Fabrication!!!</p>
      <br>
      <p>This week we'll be using the Shaper device alongside Fusion 360 and Adobe Illustrator. </p>
      <p>These tools will allow us to cut and carve wood materials into a personalized item organizer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Before we begin, let's go over how to set up and design our object.</p>
      <hr>
      <p><img src="shaper_fusion1.png"></p>
      <p>To start, I opened up Fusion 360. It should open to a page similar to the one above.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_inches.png"></p>
      <p>Before starting, make sure the measurements are in inches.</p>
      <p>This setting is under the "Document Settings" tab.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_sketch.png"></p>
      <p>From there, go to Create â†’ Create Sketch. </p>
      <p>This mode allows us to create two-dimensional shapes, which we can then turn into three-dimensional objects.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Select the x-y plane and create an 8.5in x 12.5in two-point rectangle.</p>
      <p>This outline will represent the surface area of the stock wood material.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After tracing the stock outline, we will make a profile cut.</p>
      <p>This cut will determine the dimensions of the final product.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_fillet.png"></p>
      <p>Leave at least a half-inch between the perimeters of the stock and the organizer itself.</p>
      <p>I added a fillet to the edge of the profile cut at this point in the sketch.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_circle.png"></p>
      <P>From here, we can design the features of the item organizer.</P>
      <p>I added a circle with a 3-inch diameter and another 2.25-inch one inside of the first circle.</p>
      <p>We will cut the in-between area to create a cupholder.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_phone_holder.png"></p>
      <p>Then, I added a compartment to hold my phone.</p>
      <p>I measured out a 5.8in x 2.9in rectangle with room to slide my phone in and out.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After that, I added a 5.5in x 0.3in rectangle near the phone compartment.</p>
      <p>The compartment is large enough to fit sharpie pens or certain highlighters.</p>
      <p>I chose to fillet the corners of this rectangle.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Finally, I measured out a 4.9in x 0.5in rectangle with smooth corners.</p>
      <p>I made the rectangle large enough to hold a sharpened pencil on hand when measuring out the sketch.</p>
      <p>I would have measured a brand new, unsharpened pencil in hind's sight when creating this compartment.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With the sketch of the item organizer completed, I clicked "Finish Sketch."</p>
      <p>From this point, we can start extruding the individual components to create a render of the final product.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_extrude1.png"></p>
      <p>I extruded the sketch's outline and the interior area to 0.75 inches.</p>
      <p>These extrusions allow the render to match the wood we will be cutting.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_extrude2.png"></p>
      <p>Then, I did the same with the base of each compartment, but only by 0.25in.</p>
      <p>The result is pockets deep enough to hold items.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_extrude3.png"></p>
      <p>I did, however, extrude the inner circle to 0.75 inches so that it would be at surface height with the majority of the board.</p>
      <p>This component will be used in next week's project, as it will hold a printed pot.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_render.png"></p>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p>With the render done, we will export our design to Adobe Illustrator.</p>
      <p>Through Illustrator, we can designate which cuts will apply to different sections of the board.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_ai1.png"></p>
      <p>Export the file as a .DXF and convert it to a .AI file (you can do this for free online).</p>
      <p>Open the .AI file in Illustrator and make sure to scale the proportions to the measurements of the wood stock.</p>
      <p>Delete the outer outline since the stock wood is already pre-cut to that shape.</p>
      <p><img src="cnc_AI_Graph.png"></p>
      <p>Using this illustration, we can determine the types of cuts used on the Shaper.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_ai2.png"></p>
      <p>I colored the circle black to create an exterior cut.</p>
      <p>Then, I filled the compartments gray to make them pocketed.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I added a gray text with my last name.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_notext.jpg"></p>
      <p>Don't make the same mistake I made on my first go:</p>
      <p>Make sure to turn the text into a vector; otherwise, the Shaper will not detect the text!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Finally, save the file as an .SVG file and transfer it to a Shaper-compatible storage device.</p>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p>Now, we will move the file over to the Shaper.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_safety.jpg"></p>
      <p>Before starting, I received training for the Shaper device.</p>
      <p>Please make sure to follow the safety precautions (found in the Fiber Lab).</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_equipment.png"></p>
      <p>I prepared myself with all the necessary safety equipment and vacuumed the workspace.</p>
      <p>Then, I picked up the wood stock and put double-sided tape on it.</p>
      <p>I also screwed down the wood stock to the table so that it would not move during cutting.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_screw1.jpg"></p>
      <p>This organizer incorporates two types of cuts, meaning we will be using two endmills.</p>
      <p>To switch endmills, utilize this tool on the drill to detach it.</p>
      <p>(You should turn off/unplug the Shaper when doing this step)</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_wrench1.jpg"></p>
      <p>Unscrew the endmill with a wrench (if the wrong endmill is attached).</p>
      <p>Then, insert the desired endmill about 2/3rds of the way into the drill.</p>
      <p>Finally, reattach the drill and insert the USB into the Shaper.</p>
      <br>
      <p><img src="shaper_board.jpg"></p>
      <p>The next step is to scan the surface of the cutting area.</p>
      <p>Make sure to scan the tape during this step thoroughly.</p>
      <br>
      <p>At this point, I imported my design to the Shaper interface and placed it within the wood stock.</p>
      <p>I calibrated the endmill using the z-touch featured and turned on the vacuum for cutting.</p>
      <p>With all of the preparations complete, it's time to start cutting.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I ordered the cuts by which endmill I used, starting with pocket cuts.</p>
      <p>For each cut, I made sure to adjust the settings to match the dimensions of my sketch.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_greenbutton.png"></p>
      <p>I selected each element and pressed the turquoise cut button.</p>
      <p>Then, I moved the Shaper along the cutting path.</p>
      <p>I switched endmills and finished my exterior cuts.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_messedboard1.jpg"></p>
      <p>With all of that done, I detached my organizer and sanded it off.</p>
      <p>I did, however, make several mistakes with my first attempt.</p>
      <p>For example, I used the wrong endmill on several of my cuts.</p>
      <p>Luckily, I was able to do a much more successful second run.</p>
      <p><img src="shaper_emptyfinal.jpg"><img src="shaper_emptyfinal2.jpg"></p>
      <p><img src="shaper_finished2.png"></p>
      <p>Here is how my project turned out.</p>
