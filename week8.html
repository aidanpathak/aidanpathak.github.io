<p>Hello and welcome to the Integrate project of Digital Fabrication.</p>
<p>This week we'll be using several machines to construct components for an edge-lit acrylic sign.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="integrate_chip1.png"></p>
<p>Since we are using multiple machines this week, the instructions are not as chronological as previous weeks.</p>
<p>I started with electronics training, where I learned how to make a working circuit similar to the one above.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="integrate_machine1.png"></p>
<p>To start the circuit, I learned how to use the circuit-cutting machine to cut PCB plates.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_tool2.png"><img src="integrate_chip2.png"></p>
<p>The machine uses two endmills: one for cutting the copper plating and one for the PCB itself.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_tool1.png"><img src="integrate_machine2.png"></p>
<p>To switch endmills, use this tool on the drill to loosen or tighten the drill.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_software1.png"></p>
<p>Once the proper endmill is secured, open the accompanying software and move the endmill to where you want to cut.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_software2.png"></p>
<p>Move the endmill as close to the board as possible (without touching it) and set the X/Y and Z origins.</p>
<p>These buttons let the machine know where to designate the cuts.</p>
<p>Load the desired file and close the machine. I used a board design by Tuna, one of the TAs for Digital Fabrication (shoutout!).</p>
<p><img src="integrate_machine3.png"></p>
<p>Then click cut and watch to make sure the endmill is cutting through the copper layer properly.</p>
<p>The machine should shave off the unnecessary sections of copper, leaving only conductive segments for our chip to use.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_machine12.png"><img src="integrate_vacuum.png"></p>
<p>Once the top layer finishes, make sure to open the machine and use this ghostbuster-looking vacuum to remove any leftover copper dust.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_machine8.png"></p>
<p>Switch to the PCB-designated endmill and loosen the drill so that the endmill lands softly on the cutting area.</p>
<p>Re-tighten the endmill and use the software to lift it slightly above the board.</p>
<p>Select cut again, and repeat the same steps as before until the machine is properly clean.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_chip3.png"></p>
<p>Mine came out like this, although the class later changed the designs used in the final project.</p>
<p>Remove the chip from the rest of the board and move it towards a soldering station.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="integrate_burn1.png"></p>
<p>In training, we used a Yihua Soldering Station to attach our electronic components to the circuit board.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_burn4.png"></p>
<p>Soldering uses intense heat to connect components, so be very careful during this step.</p>
<p>I used this grip device to hold my circuit board in place to solder from a safe distance.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_burn6.png"></p>
<p>I placed the soldering glue on the connection points of the board and attached the components on top.</p>
<p>Then I used the heating device to melt the glue. After a few seconds, the components bonded to the circuit board.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_chip7.png"></p>
<p>My final circuit came out like such.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we will be using pre-made circuit boards in the final product.</p>
<hr>
<p>After creating the circuit board, I went to Adobe Illustrator to construct a laser-cut acrylic design for the final lamp.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_ai4.png"></p>
<p>I downloaded this template for the base of the acrylic component.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_ai.png"></p>
<p>For some time, I experimented with the tools in illustrator to get a basic design going.</p>
<p>After a while, I came up with the above design.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_ai2.png"></p>
<p>I wasn't satisfied with the simplistic design, so I downloaded an R2D2 vector and added it to the base.</p>
<p>I also used the curved text feature to add a silly quote near the base of the lamp.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_ai3.png"></p>
<p>I finally produced this near-final draft. However, at some point, I accidentally rastered the image.</p>
<p>Rastering the image means that the Glowforge will not detect and cut the outer line.</p>
<p>I am currently still fixing this issue, so my acrylic component is not yet finished.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="integrate_ai5.png"></p>
<p>Before we move on from the Glowforge, I should mention that one component was pre-designed for this project.</p>
<p>This segment will house the acrylic and electric components of the final product.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another step towards making the final product is to design a 3D-printed exterior container to hold the electronic components.</p>
<p>As in previous weeks, we will be using Fusion 360 to design the exterior container.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_fusion_offset.png"></p>
<p>I started with a rectangular sketch about the same size as the components pre-cut in the Fiber Lab for us.</p>
<p>I also added a 0.025in offset to allow extra space for the components to fit in.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_fusion_extrude1.png"></p>
<p>Then I extruded the in-between space to be tall enough to fit all of the components inside.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_fusion1.png"></p>
<p>Finally, I added a rectangular sketch to one side of the exterior box.</p>
<p>I extruded this as a cut from the main body, creating a hole for the electronic components to fit in.</p>
<p><img src="integrate_render.png"></p>
<p>Here is a render of the final product.</p>
<p>When I printed this piece, I hadn't yet added the rectangular hole for the electronic components.</p>
<br>
<p>I still have to print the updated exterior and laser-cut the redesign of my acrylic piece, so my final product is not complete.</p>
<p>However, I learned to print the exterior with the electronic port and not raster my acrylic cut.</p>
